## Welcome to GitHub Pages

No ideas for edits.
How abut I write a one of my stories here?

Read on People!

Strangers


You walked past me today.
Feels like we’ve met somewhere before. That I knew everything about you. 
Your smiles and tears, I have them carved out in my heart.

I could read you blindly, when you stopped by.

But, the hollow words that you spoke
I knew I had read you wrong.

You’ve got a life beyond our promises.

No, it ain’t you that I miss. 
It’s the old you, who knew my worth.

I’ve never known you. We are strangers.


Gimme comments!!
